# CivicTrack - Issue Reporting System

CivicTrack is a civic issue reporting and tracking application that allows citizens to report local problems like potholes, broken street lights, and other municipal issues in their community.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Issue Reporting**: Citizens can report civic issues with descriptions, photos, and location data
- **Map & Grid Views**: Visualize issues on an interactive map or browse in a grid layout
- **Status Tracking**: Track issue progress from "Reported" to "In Progress" to "Resolved"
- **Location-based**: Only shows issues within a configurable radius (1km, 3km, 5km)
- **Filtering**: Filter issues by category, status, and distance
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Option to report issues anonymously
- **Upvoting System**: Community members can upvote issues to show priority

### Categories
- Roads (potholes, obstructions)
- Lighting (broken or flickering lights)
- Water Supply (leaks, low pressure)
- Cleanliness (overflowing bins, garbage)
- Public Safety (open manholes, exposed wiring)
- Obstructions (fallen trees, debris)

### User Roles
- **Citizens**: Can report and view issues, upvote issues
- **Admins**: Can update issue status and manage the platform

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for data persistence
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing

### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Leaflet** for interactive maps
- **Clerk** for authentication (frontend)
- **React Router** for navigation
